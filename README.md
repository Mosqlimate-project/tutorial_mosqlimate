# tutorial_mosqlimate
This repository is an example of how the mosqlimate platform can be used to registry your model and save your predictions.


All the codes in this repo where done based on the documentation of the [Mosqlimate Project](https://api.mosqlimate.org/docs/). 

In this repo we will train a model to predict the dengue cases in Rio de Janeiro city using the data available in the Mosqlimate Project. To achieve it we will used a simple univariate forecast based on neural networks implemented by [Neural Prophet](https://neuralprophet.com/contents.html).
