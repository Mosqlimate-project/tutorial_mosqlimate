# tutorial_mosqlimate
This repository exemplifies how the mosqlimate platform can register your model and save predictions.


All the codes in this repo were done based on the documentation of the [Mosqlimate Project](https://api.mosqlimate.org/docs/). 

In this repo, we will train a model to predict the dengue cases in Rio de Janeiro city using the data available in the Mosqlimate Project. To achieve it, we will use a simple univariate forecast based on neural networks implemented by [Neural Prophet](https://neuralprophet.com/contents.html). 

The objective of this tutorial is to provide a complete example of how the platform can be used. After following all the steps, we will be able to see your data in the Mosqlimate/vis as shown below:

The first step is to clone this repo in your personal GitHub account. You can see an example of cloning a repository [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 
Also, it's necessary to create an account on the [platform](https://api.mosqlimate.org/). It's really simple; you can log in with your own GitHub account. 


After creating an account, let's start to build the model. The first step is obtaining the notebook data: `get_data_from_mosqlimate.ipynb`.
